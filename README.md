## Clarifications

At the previous example there were very few checkpoints.

In order to generate a smooth drive the amount of checkpoints must be significantly higher than the one used for this example. 
This can be achieved by using a pathfinder or something similar.

The purpose of this repository is only to take control of the car. Not to map the game's map or know where to drive to.
